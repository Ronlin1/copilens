# Remote Repository Analysis - Quick Start

## New Feature: Analyze Any Public GitHub/GitLab Repository! 🚀

Copilens can now analyze public repositories with Gemini 3 Pro's advanced capabilities:
- **Deep Thinking** - HIGH-level reasoning about code
- **Google Search** - Contextual information about repos
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Security, quality, architecture

---

## Quick Commands

### 1. Quick Scan (No API Key Needed)

```powershell
copilens remote quick https://github.com/user/repo
```

Shows:
- Project type and architecture  
- Languages and frameworks
- File counts and code stats
- Quality score

### 2. Full AI Analysis (Gemini API Key Required)

```powershell
# Set API key first
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Comprehensive analysis
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/user/repo

# Security-focused
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/user/repo --type security

# Code quality analysis
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/user/repo --type quality

# Architecture analysis
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/user/repo --type architecture
```

---

## Analysis Types

### Comprehensive (Default)

4. **AI-Generated Code Detection** (0-100% likelihood)
5. Security Analysis
6. Performance Assessment
7. Dependencies & Tech Stack
8. Best Practices Compliance
9. Top 5 Improvement Recommendations
10. Deployment Readiness

### Security
Focused security analysis:
- Vulnerability assessment (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Secret exposure risks
- Security best practices
- Prioritized fixes
- Security score (0-100)

### Quality
Code quality deep-dive:
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Code duplication
- Technical debt
- Test coverage
- Maintainability score
- Refactoring opportunities

### Architecture
Architecture evaluation:
- Pattern identification (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Component design
- Scalability assessment
- Technology choices
- Architecture score (0-100)
- Refactoring recommendations

---

## Supported Platforms

- ✅ GitHub (`github.com/user/repo`)
- ✅ GitLab (`gitlab.com/user/repo`)  
- ✅ Bitbucket (`bitbucket.org/user/repo`)
- ✅ Any Git URL ending in `.git`

---

## Example Workflows

### Evaluate a Library Before Using It

```powershell
# Quick check
copilens remote quick https://github.com/library/awesome-lib

# Deep security analysis
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/library/awesome-lib --type security
```

### Assess Code Quality of Your Own Repo

```powershell
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/yourname/yourproject --type quality --save quality-report.md
```

### Learn from Open Source Projects

```powershell
# Analyze famous repos
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/facebook/react --type architecture

copilens remote analyze https://github.com/openai/whisper --type comprehensive
```

## What Makes This Powerful?

### 1. Gemini 3 Pro with Deep Thinking
- **HIGH-level thinking** enabled
- Analyzes code patterns and intent
- Provides reasoning for conclusions

### 2. Google Search Integration
- Finds context about the repository
- Checks community feedback and issues
- Discovers best practices for the tech stack

### 3. AI-Generated Code Detection
Copilens can estimate if code was AI-generated by analyzing:
- Comment verbosity and style
- Consistent formatting patterns
- Generic variable names
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hint coverage

**Confidence Levels:**
- **80-100%**: Very likely AI-generated
- **50-79%**: Possibly AI-generated  
- **0-49%**: Likely human-written

### 4. No Local Cloning Required
- Copilens handles cloning to temp directory
- Automatically cleaned up after analysis
- Shallow clone for speed (--depth 1)

## API Key Setup

### Get Free Gemini API Key

```
https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
```

### Set in PowerShell

```powershell
# Current session
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Permanent
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'your-key', 'User')
```

### Or use .env file

Create `.env` in your project:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

---

## Save Reports

```powershell
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/user/repo --save report.md
```

Report includes:
- Repository information
- Architecture summary
- Code statistics
- **Full AI analysis in Markdown**

---

## Requirements

- Git must be installed (`git --version` to check)
- Internet connection (for cloning)
- Gemini API key (for AI analysis)

Install Git:
```
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

---

## Tips

💡 **Start with quick scan** - No API key needed, instant results

💡 **Use --type for focused analysis** - Faster and more targeted

💡 **Save reports** - Keep AI analysis for documentation

💡 **Analyze before forking** - Check code quality and security first

💡 **Compare architectures** - Analyze similar projects to learn patterns

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Git not found"
```powershell
# Install Git
winget install Git.Git

# Or download from https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

### "Clone timeout"
Repository is too large. Copilens uses shallow clone with 5-minute timeout.

### "No LLM provider available"
```powershell
# Set API key
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Verify
python -c "import os; print(os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))"
```

### Rate Limits
Gemini Free Tier: 15 requests/minute, 1500 requests/day

Use `--type` for faster, smaller analyses to stay within limits.

---

## Examples

### Analyze Copilens Itself!

```powershell
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/yourusername/copilens --type comprehensive
```

### Compare Frameworks

```powershell
# React
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/facebook/react --type architecture

# Vue
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/vuejs/core --type architecture
```

### Security Audit

```powershell
copilens remote analyze https://github.com/company/app --type security --save security-audit.md
```
